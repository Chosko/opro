# Permissions

Permissions give the user a way to control the scope of access that a client application has to their data. This is similar to how Facebook will ask users what actions an app can take on their part.


<% if ::Opro.request_permissions.present? && ::Opro.request_permissions.map(&:to_s).include?("write") %>

## Write Access

To perform any type of request other than a GET ([HTTP Request methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods)), your application must have `write` access to the user. You can specify this scope (see Request Scope below) or by default all permissions will be requested.

<% end %>

## Request Scope

As a client app you can request specific scopes while you are authing a user, if no scope is specified all permissions will be requested.

      <%= "#{request.base_url}/oauth/authorize?" %>scope[]=write&#... %>

While authorizing your app a user can choose to accept or deny individual permissions.


## Available Permissions/Scopes

These are the available permissions you can request as a client application. If no scope is provided, all permissions will be requested.
